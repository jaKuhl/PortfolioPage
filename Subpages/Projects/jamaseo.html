            <h3>The story behind the project</h3>
            

            <p>In the context of the course "Management of Innovation and Change in Health Care Institutions", 
                we as students had to develop a product idea and put together the business plan for a corresponding 
                company. In doing so, we dealt with topics such as design thinking, project planning and creating a 
                business plan in more detail.
                <br><br>

                After a short ideation phase, together as a group we developed the Recovery.Tag and the corresponding 
                Recovery.App. The idea behind our company was to digitise the patient tag, which is used to categorise 
                injured people during large-scale operations and disasters.
                <br><br>
                During the project, I was responsible for the conception and design of our products as well as the 
                presentation of our company. In addition, I took care of a logo and the brand identity of our company
                 right at the beginning.

            <h3>Project goal</h3>

            <div>
            <p>Patient attachment cards are used in all large-scale operations of the fire brigade and rescue service for 
                the uniform registration of patient data and for the documentation of injuries as well as the measures carried out. Patients can thus be better prioritised and cared for. 
                <br><br>
                During triage, as a minimum, the patient number, the sighting category, the time, the name of the 
                examining doctor and a brief diagnosis must be recorded on the casualty tag. The sighting categories are 
                usually pre-printed and only need to be ticked. In order to recognise the status of the patient even from a 
                distance, new cards are equipped with a colour card. Here, red stands for category 1, yellow for 2, green 
                for 3, blue or grey for 4 and black for deceased.
                <br><br>
                
                <strong>The goal of the project was to digitize this patient attachment card.</strong></p>

                  <p>To develop the idea of our service, we summarised the digitalised process together as a group into 
                    a user journey in order to visualise all the necessary steps. On the basis of this journey, we were 
                    then able to determine which products we needed and what exactly the application of these products 
                    should look like. </p>

                <button class="accordion"><span>Step 2 - </span><strong>Design of the recovery tag</strong></button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>The recovery tag should function as a storage medium in the course of casualty registration, which 
                        is hung around the neck of the casualties instead of the patient lanyard card. Each tag 
                        should be scannable with a smartphone using NFC technology. All relevant information can then be 
                        entered via the Recovery.app and transmitted to the Recovery.tag. All the data stored on the tag can 
                        then be read out and added to by doctors or nurses at a later stage. In addition, all Recovery.Tags should 
                        be able to flash in different colours so that the status of the injured can be easily recognised from a distance.  
                        These considerations resulted in various requirements that had to be taken into account in the design of the Recovery. 
                        Tag:  Compact, small form NFC compatible Integrated LED light  Lanyard for attaching the tag  After defining these 
                        requirements for our product, I collected the first sketches for the tag and used these drawings to model an 
                        initial 3D model in Vectary. This model also served as a prototype later in the presentation. </p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>After the Recovery.Tag had been modelled and was ready for presentation, I started conceptualising the Recovery.App. 
                        The Recovery.App was to be available on both the iPhone and the iPad. The iPhone app was mainly used to register 
                        the patient data at the site. To be able to design the app, I first collected all the important steps of the 
                        current patient transfer card in a process overview.</p>

                    <p>Once I had an idea of the steps that needed to be followed in the app's injured person 
                        registration, I put together the iPhone version of the Recovery.App in Figma. In doing so,
                         I mainly followed the best practices of mobile user onboarding.  When designing the app, 
                         the main thing to keep in mind was that users primarily use the app in extremely stressful 
                         situations and they need to quickly and easily record the data of the injured.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>The iPhone version was to be supplemented by an iPad version for the head of operations. On the iPad, the Recovery.app 
                        should function as a kind of dashboard. The incident commander should be able to get a quick overview 
                        of the casualty situation. In addition, the incident commander should be able to view and add to all 
                        patient information.</p>

                        the final step of the project was to present our products and our company. For this purpose, 
                        I put together a prototype of the apps and integrated it into the company presentation I had created. 
                        This allowed us to let the audience click through the prototype themselves in a demo. </p>

            <h3>The story behind the project</h3>
            
    
            <p>I really enjoyed incorporating my enthusiasm for product development and UX/UI design into my studies. 
                I was able to gain good experience in designing a physical and a digital product. In addition, 
                I was able to learn more about the topic of setting up a company. 
                <br><br>
    
                Overall, I found it easy to design our products, to understand and visualise the processes behind them and 
                to turn my design ideas into a functional app (in Figma). I am very proud of the fact that I managed to 
                give our company a brand identity and to design our products very consistently based on this. <br><br>
                
                Considering the limited time we had, I am extremely satisfied with the result.<br><br>
                
                For future projects, I have already decided to document my work and my way to the finished designs in more detail. 
                Especially when writing this project summary, I noticed that many of my sketches and notes were no longer available. 
                Especially analogue notes and ideas were no longer available. To avoid this problem in the future, 
                I will try to record all my thoughts and progress digitally. <br><br>

                In addition, I will try to better methodically underpin comparable projects in the future 
                in order to gain experience and learn new skills in this area as well.
